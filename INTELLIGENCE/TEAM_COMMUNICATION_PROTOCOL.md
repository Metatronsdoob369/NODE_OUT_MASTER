# üéØ TEAM COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL - "LEAVE NOTES EVERYWHERE"

## What We Learned Today

### ‚ùå **WHAT WENT WRONG:**
- Claude sessions started with "Hey how can I help" instead of loading context
- Built new React apps instead of using existing working payment portal
- Multiple ports serving different apps (confusion chaos)
- Backend using hardcoded test keys instead of config.env
- No context continuity between Claude sessions

### ‚úÖ **WHAT WENT RIGHT:**
- Trip wire system implemented (`CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE_SESSION_STARTUP.js`)
- Hierarchical memory system with Firebase
- Backend properly configured to read config.env
- Working payment portal deployed with live Stripe keys
- Quality-first mindset maintained

## üö® **MILITANT COMMUNICATION RULES**

### **FOR CLAUDE ENTERING PROJECT:**
1. **ALWAYS RUN FIRST**: `node CLAUDE_SESSION_STARTUP.js`
2. **VERIFY BEFORE BUILDING**: Check what exists before creating new
3. **READ THE WORKING DIRECTORY**: Don't assume, verify what's actually running
4. **ASK "HOLD UP"**: If unsure, stop and verify before proceeding

### **FOR PROJECT OWNER:**
1. **CONTEXT FIRST**: Point new Claude to trip wire immediately
2. **WORKING SYSTEM PRIORITY**: Use existing before building new
3. **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**: All APIs in config.env, no hardcoded values
4. **QUALITY GATE**: "I'll never sacrifice quality to please me"

## üìã **LEAVE NOTES EVERYWHERE CHECKLIST**

### **Every File Should Have:**
- [ ] Purpose clearly stated at top
- [ ] Dependencies documented
- [ ] Last working status noted
- [ ] Contact with related files

### **Every Directory Should Have:**
- [ ] README.md explaining contents
- [ ] Working status documented
- [ ] Instructions for new team members

### **Every Session Should:**
- [ ] Load context first (`CLAUDE_SESSION_STARTUP.js`)
- [ ] Verify working system status
- [ ] Document any changes made
- [ ] Update memory system with progress

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Communication Success:**
- [ ] New Claude loads context in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Zero "What is this project?" questions
- [ ] Working system identified immediately
- [ ] No duplicate/conflicting builds

### **Technical Success:**
- [ ] Working payment portal accessible
- [ ] Backend reads config.env properly
- [ ] Live payments processing correctly
- [ ] Domain properly deployed

## üîÑ **DAILY PROTOCOL**

### **Start of Session:**
1. Run: `node CLAUDE_SESSION_STARTUP.js`
2. Verify: System status and working components
3. Check: Any updates needed from memory system
4. Proceed: With full context loaded

### **End of Session:**
1. Update: Memory system with progress
2. Document: Any changes or discoveries
3. Test: Working system still functional
4. Note: Next session priorities

## üí° **TEAM MANTRAS**

- **"Trip the wire first, build second"**
- **"Quality over speed, always"**
- **"Use what works, improve what doesn't"**
- **"Leave notes everywhere"**
- **"Context first, code second"**

**This protocol ensures we never lose progress and always maintain the quality standards that drive success.**
