  "scrape_method": "Quantitative finance + market pattern analysis + portfolio theory + risk mathematics + compound interest modeling + technical analysis",
  "raw_data_snippet": "Portfolio allocation: 61.8% growth, 38.2% stability (golden ratio). Rebalancing: Fibonacci intervals (1,2,3,5,8,13 months). Compound growth: e^(rt) exponential curves. Risk: \u221an diversification mathematics",
  "replication_instruction": "Apply golden ratio to portfolio allocation, use fibonacci timing for market entries, leverage compound interest mathematics for wealth building, implement fractal risk management across time horizons"
