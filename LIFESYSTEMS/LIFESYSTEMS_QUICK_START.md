## üèóÔ∏è **PHASE 2: QUICK SETUP** *(15 Minutes)*

### **Create Your Life Command Center**
```bash
# Navigate to your LIFESYSTEMS
cd LIFESYSTEMS/personal_architecture/life_operating_system/

# Create your personal directories
mkdir -p deployed_life/{income_systems,health_systems,relationship_systems,daily_operations}
mkdir -p development_life/{skill_enhancement,relationship_building,financial_growth,personal_experiments}
mkdir -p memory_life/{knowledge_vault,decision_framework,rapid_access}
mkdir -p utilities_life/{automation_tools,maintenance_routines,emergency_protocols}
```

### **Essential First Files**
Create these 3 critical files:

**1. Daily Priorities** 
```bash
# Create: memory_life/rapid_access/daily_priorities.md
```
Write your top 3 priorities for today in each category:
- Business/Career
- Health/Energy  
- Relationships/Personal

**2. Core Values**
```bash
# Create: memory_life/decision_framework/core_values.md
```
List your 5 most important values (examples: integrity, growth, love, excellence, freedom)

**3. Morning Routine**
```bash
# Create: deployed_life/daily_operations/morning_routine.md
```
Document what you actually do each morning (not what you think you should do)
