# The NODE_OUT Method

## Craft AI Discovery Framework

### Core Philosophy
Never ask if they need help. Guide them to tell you where they're struggling through empathetic conversation and strategic redirection.

### The 5-Step Process

#### 1. Empathy Hook
Get them talking by showing you understand their world:
- *"Running a roofing company must be like conducting an orchestra while the weather keeps changing the music..."*
- *"Restaurant management seems to require the skills of a chef, therapist, accountant, and crisis manager all rolled into one..."*

#### 2. Momentum Builders
Keep them sharing with industry-specific observations:
- *"Storm season must completely transform how you operate..."*
- *"Staff scheduling must feel like solving a Rubik's cube blindfolded..."*

#### 3. Strategic Redirects
When conversation slows, use "How are you affected by...":
- *"How are you affected by... last-minute weather changes?"*
- *"How are you affected by... no-shows during your busiest shifts?"*

#### 4. Organic Discovery
Let them teach you about their unique challenges without feeling sold to

#### 5. Solution Bridge
Present possibilities as collaborative discoveries:
- *"What if weather changes automatically triggered customer notifications..."*
- *"I wonder if there's a way to predict staffing needs based on historical patterns..."*
