# TIER 2/3 CITY DOMINATION STRATEGY
**Commander's Strategic Insight: Small Cities = Market Monopoly**

## WHY TIER 2/3 CITIES WIN
- **Competition**: 5-10 inactive creators vs 10,000+ in major cities
- **Authority**: Instant local credibility - everyone knows everyone  
- **Loyalty**: Generational families with STRONG local pride
- **Content Gaps**: ZERO local money content exists
- **Monetization**: Premium rates due to zero competition

## TARGET CITIES (SOUTHERN EXPANSION)
1. **Mobile, AL** (430k metro) - Port city, shipbuilding, Gulf Coast tourism
2. **Huntsville, AL** (491k metro) - NASA/aerospace, high-income tech workers
3. **Montgomery, AL** (373k metro) - State capital, military, government
4. **Shreveport, LA** (393k metro) - Oil/gas, gaming, military
5. **Jackson, MS** (594k metro) - State capital, healthcare, university

## MOBILE TESTING GROUND
**Perfect Proof-of-Concept Target:**
- Historic port city = built-in local pride
- Large enough for scale, small enough to dominate
- Zero competition in local money content
- Content opportunities: Maritime, tourism, manufacturing, historic district
