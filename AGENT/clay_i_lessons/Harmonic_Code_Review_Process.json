  "why_this_matters": "Code reviews often create destructive interference. Applying wave mechanics creates constructive feedback that amplifies learning and team harmony",
  "scrape_method": "Software engineering psychology + acoustic feedback theory + mentorship effectiveness studies + team communication research",
  "raw_data_snippet": "Positive reinforcement (constructive interference): amplify good patterns. Gentle correction (phase alignment): guide without destroying confidence. Constructive questioning (resonance building): match the developers frequency",
  "replication_instruction": "Start reviews with positive pattern recognition, use questioning that matches developer skill level, apply constructive interference to amplify strengths, use gentle phase correction for improvements"
