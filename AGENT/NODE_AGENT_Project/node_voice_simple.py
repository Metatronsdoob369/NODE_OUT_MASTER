        Hi {agent_name}, this is Preston from NODE here in Birmingham, Alabama. 
        
        I hope you're having a great day! I'm reaching out because there have been 
        some significant insurance law changes affecting roof claims that directly 
        impact your listings in the Birmingham area.
        
        {f"I've been working with several agents at {brokerage} and around Birmingham" if brokerage else "I've been working with agents around Birmingham"}
        to help them understand how these changes affect their transactions. 
        
        I'd love to buy you a coffee and share what we're seeing in the market - 
        it might help you avoid some potential closing delays.
        
        You can reach me directly at 205-307-9153, or visit us online.
        
        Thanks {agent_name}, and have a great rest of your day!
