NODE OUT SIP Agent Workflow - Needs List

API Keys & Auth Required:
✔ Apify API Key
   - Required for YouTube & X (Twitter) scraping HTTP Request nodes.

✔ OpenAI API Key
   - Required for AI content generation, research agent logic, content formatting nodes.

✔ LinkedIn API/Auth or Social Scheduler Credentials
   - Required for "Post on LinkedIn" node.
   - May require external scheduler (Zapier, Buffer, etc.) if direct API access isn't configured.

External Services to Set Up:
✔ Apify account with relevant YouTube & X scrapers.
✔ OpenAI account with API access (GPT-4 recommended).
✔ LinkedIn account with posting access method (API or scheduler integration).
✔ Optional: Image generation service (DALL·E, Stability, etc.) if your workflow's image nodes depend on it.

System Assumptions:
✔ "Simple Memory" nodes handle temporary AI output internally—no external setup.
✔ Image prompt and content formatting steps require no special setup beyond valid AI responses.
✔ NODE OUT folder system or LM content can be easily layered into these nodes later.

Next Recommended Steps:
1. Gather API keys and credentials.
2. Wire them into the appropriate N8N nodes.
3. Run partial workflow tests with real data.
4. Add LM/NODE OUT enhancements when ready.
