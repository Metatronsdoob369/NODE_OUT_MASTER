NODE OUT / SIP Agent Evolution Roadmap (First 60 Days)

Phase 1 — Solid Foundations (Day 1–14)
Goal: Get confident running and lightly modifying the existing N8N system.

- Import the SIP Agent Workflow into your N8N.
- Run it with dummy inputs — YouTube video, Tweet examples.
- Watch how it flows → Scrape → AI generates content → Slack approvals → LinkedIn output.
- Swap one AI model or one output (test OpenRouter vs GPT-4o mini).
- OPTIONAL: Connect it to a small Airtable or Google Sheet to log final outputs.

Outcome:
✔ You see it working.
✔ You're tweaking the basics without fear.
✔ You can show the workflow skeleton to trusted peers or potential clients (don’t oversell yet).

Phase 2 — Early Client-Ready Polish (Day 15–30)
Goal: Make this feel approachable and client-friendly.

- Link the workflow to your clean NODE OUT folder structure.
- Every AI-generated draft gets stored to /NODE_OUT_Master/Client_Projects/CLIENT/Content_Drafts.
- Start building your React+Firebase Portal:
  • Page to show content drafts.
  • Simple Approve/Edit buttons (manual for now).
- Replace Slack approvals with your web-based approval option.
- Layer in NotebookLM as a prep step for research or idea sourcing.

Outcome:
✔ System feels like a real product, not a dev playground.
✔ You can show a small biz owner how the AI drafts, stores, and routes content.
✔ They approve from your clean client portal, not inside your tech stack.

Phase 3 — High-Leverage Expansion (Day 31–60)
Goal: Turn this into a scalable, productized AI system.

- Add SEO blog/article output layer (use same AI logic).
- Extend to email content or paid ad variants.
- Integrate better database tracking (Airtable, Firebase DB).
- Start building automated reports → "Here's your AI-created content this month."
- Soft launch to early paying clients (beta pricing).
- OPTIONAL: Begin prepping long-form LM-generated assets as an upsell.

Outcome:
✔ This is a real, sellable system for AI-enhanced content creation.
✔ You’re leveraging the same N8N spine for multiple content types.
✔ Clients see a clean, easy-to-use interface — all complexity hidden.

Blunt Translation:
Treat this like the blueprint and origin file for a product — not random notes.
NODE_OUT_Master owns it.
Notion/Airtable tracks it.
