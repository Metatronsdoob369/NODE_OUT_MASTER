Terminal Confidence Reps Guide (File Movement & Location Mastery)

Goal: Build instincts for knowing where files are, moving them clean, and renaming with confidence.

---

1. **Know Where You Are**
Check your current location:
    pwd

List what's in your current folder:
    ls

---

2. **See What's in a Specific Folder**
List contents of your home folder:
    ls ~

List contents of a subfolder (e.g., your NODE_OUT_Master structure):
    ls ~/NODE_OUT_Master
    ls ~/NODE_OUT_Master/SIP_AGENT_Workflow

---

3. **Move a File**
Move a file from one folder to another:
    mv [source path] [destination path]

Example - Move Roadmap file to Workflow folder:
    mv ~/Downloads/Roadmap.txt ~/NODE_OUT_Master/SIP_AGENT_Workflow/

---

4. **Rename a File While Moving**
    mv ~/NODE_OUT_Master/SIP_AGENT_Workflow/Roadmap.txt ~/NODE_OUT_Master/SIP_AGENT_Workflow/Final_Roadmap.txt

---

5. **Rename a Folder**
    mv ~/NODE_OUT_Master/Old_Folder_Name ~/NODE_OUT_Master/New_Folder_Name

---

6. **Open a File in VS Code from Terminal**
    code ~/NODE_OUT_Master/SIP_AGENT_Workflow/Roadmap.txt

(Note: You need VS Code's 'code' CLI installed. I can show you how.)

---

7. **Final Tip: Avoid Spaces in File/Folder Names**
Spaces make terminal navigation harder. Use underscores or CamelCase instead.

8. Quick Peek Shortcut: ALIAS
alias siptodo='open ~/NODE_OUT_Master/Terminal_Notes/NODE_OUT_SIP_Agent_Needs_List.txt'
Then siptodo opens

Keep practicing these small, daily reps. Terminal fluency = massive long-term time savings.
