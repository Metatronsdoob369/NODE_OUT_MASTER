Yet, the extent to which DNNs capture fundamental\naspects of human vision such as color perception remains unclear. Here, we\ndevelop novel experiments for evaluating the perceptual coherence of color\nembeddings in DNNs, and we assess how well these algorithms predict human color\nsimilarity judgments collected via an online survey. We find that\nstate-of-the-art DNN architectures $-$ including convolutional neural networks\nand vision transformers $-$ provide color similarity judgments that strikingly\ndiverge from human color judgments of (i) images with controlled color\nproperties, (ii) images generated from online searches, and (iii) real-world\nimages from the canonical CIFAR-10 dataset. We compare DNN performance against\nan interpretable and cognitively plausible model of color perception based on\nwavelet decomposition, inspired by foundational theories in computational\nneuroscience. While one deep learning model $-$ a convolutional DNN trained on\na style transfer task $-$ captures some aspects of human color perception, our\nwavelet algorithm provides more coherent color embeddings that better predict\nhuman color judgments compared to all DNNs we examine. These results hold when\naltering the high-level visual task used to train similar DNN architectures\n(e.g., image classification versus image segmentation), as well as when\nexamining the color embeddings of different layers in a given DNN architecture.\nThese findings break new ground in the effort to analyze the perceptual\nrepresentations of machine learning algorithms and to improve their ability to\nserve as cognitively plausible models of human vision. Implications for machine\nlearning, human perception, and embodied cognition are discussed.\n\n\nSource: Geometry of color perception. Part 1: Structures and metrics of a\n  homogeneous color space\n  This is the first half of a two-part paper dealing with the geometry of color\nperception. Here we analyze in detail the seminal 1974 work by H.L. Resnikoff,\nwho showed that there are only two possible geometric structures and Riemannian\nmetrics on the perceived color space P compatible with the set of\nSchr\\\"odinger's axioms completed with the hypothesis of homogeneity. We recast\nResnikoff's model into a more modern colorimetric setting, provide a much\nsimpler proof of the main result of the original paper and motivate the need of\npsychophysical experiments to confute or confirm the linearity of background\ntransformations, which act transitively on P. Finally, we show that the\nRiemannian metrics singled out by Resnikoff through an axiom on invariance\nunder background transformations are not compatibles with the crispening\neffect, thus motivating the need of further research about perceptual color\nmetrics.\n\n\nSource: Context sequence theory: a common explanation for multiple types of\n  learning\n  Although principles of neuroscience like reinforcement learning, visual\nperception and attention have been applied in machine learning models, there is\na huge gap between machine learning and mammalian learning. Based on the\nadvances in neuroscience, we propose the context sequence theory to give a\ncommon explanation for multiple types of learning in mammals and hope that can\nprovide a new insight into the construct of machine learning models.\n\n\nSource: If deep learning is the answer, then what is the question?\n  Neuroscience research is undergoing a minor revolution. Recent advances in\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) research have opened up new\nways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the\npossibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception,\ncognition and action for biological brains. This perspective has the potential\nto radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the\ncomputations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, not\nendowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to\nmodel and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists\nwho seek to characterise computations or neural codes, or who wish to\nunderstand perception, attention, memory, and executive functions? In this\nPerspective, our goal is to offer a roadmap for systems neuroscience research\nin the age of deep learning. We discuss the conceptual and methodological\nchallenges of comparing behaviour, learning dynamics, and neural representation\nin artificial and biological systems. We highlight new research questions that\nhave emerged for neuroscience as a direct consequence of recent advances in\nmachine learning.\n\n\nSource: Perceptual spaces and their symmetries: The geometry of color space\n  Our sensory systems transform external signals into neural activity, thereby\nproducing percepts. We are endowed with an intuitive notion of similarity\nbetween percepts, that need not reflect the proximity of the physical\nproperties of the corresponding external stimuli. The quantitative\ncharacterization of the geometry of percepts is therefore an endeavour that\nmust be accomplished behaviorally. Here we characterized the geometry of color\nspace using discrimination and matching experiments. We proposed an\nindividually tailored metric defined in terms of the minimal chromatic\ndifference required for each observer to differentiate a stimulus from its\nsurround. Next, we showed that this perceptual metric was particularly adequate\nto describe two additional experiments, since it revealed the natural symmetry\nof perceptual computations. In one of the experiments, observers were required\nto discriminate two stimuli surrounded by a chromaticity that differed from\nthat of the tested stimuli. In the perceptual coordinates, the change in\ndiscrimination thresholds induced by the surround followed a simple law that\nonly depended on the perceptual distance between the surround and each of the\ntwo compared stimuli. In the other experiment, subjects were asked to match the\ncolor of two stimuli surrounded by two different chromaticities. Again, in the\nperceptual coordinates the induction effect produced by surrounds followed a\nsimple, symmetric law. We conclude that the individually-tailored notion of\nperceptual distance reveals the symmetry of the laws governing perceptual\ncomputations.\n\n\nSource: Neuro-3D: Towards 3D Visual Decoding from EEG Signals\n  Human's perception of the visual world is shaped by the stereo processing of\n3D information. Understanding how the brain perceives and processes 3D visual\nstimuli in the real world has been a longstanding endeavor in neuroscience.\nTowards this goal, we introduce a new neuroscience task: decoding 3D visual\nperception from EEG signals, a neuroimaging technique that enables real-time\nmonitoring of neural dynamics enriched with complex visual cues. To provide the\nessential benchmark, we first present EEG-3D, a pioneering dataset featuring\nmultimodal analysis data and extensive EEG recordings from 12 subjects viewing\n72 categories of 3D objects rendered in both videos and images. Furthermore, we\npropose Neuro-3D, a 3D visual decoding framework based on EEG signals. This\nframework adaptively integrates EEG features derived from static and dynamic\nstimuli to learn complementary and robust neural representations, which are\nsubsequently utilized to recover both the shape and color of 3D objects through\nthe proposed diffusion-based colored point cloud decoder. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to explore EEG-based 3D visual decoding.\nExperiments indicate that Neuro-3D not only reconstructs colored 3D objects\nwith high fidelity, but also learns effective neural representations that\nenable insightful brain region analysis. The dataset and associated code will\nbe made publicly available.\n\n\nSource: The relativity of color perception\n  Physical colors, i.e. reflected or emitted lights entering the eyes from a\nvisual environment, are converted into perceived colors sensed by humans by\nneurophysiological mechanisms. These processes involve both three types of\nphotoreceptors, the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent\ninteractions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral\ngeniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently\nlinked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing\napparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the\nconceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link\nis between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship\nbetween color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first\ntime by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The\nmain purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model\nthat, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to\nexplain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception\nphenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic\nconsiderations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color\nperception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that\nsummarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the\nframework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile\ntrichromacy with Hering's opponency and also to derive the relativistic\nproperties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or\nexperimental assumption.\n\n\nSource: Deep Learning for Cognitive Neuroscience\n  Neural network models can now recognise images, understand text, translate\nlanguages, and play many human games at human or superhuman levels. These\nsystems are highly abstracted, but are inspired by biological brains and use\nonly biologically plausible computations. In the coming years, neural networks\nare likely to become less reliant on learning from massive labelled datasets,\nand more robust and generalisable in their task performance. From their\nsuccesses and failures, we can learn about the computational requirements of\nthe different tasks at which brains excel. Deep learning also provides the\ntools for testing cognitive theories. In order to test a theory, we need to\nrealise the proposed information-processing system at scale, so as to be able\nto assess its feasibility and emergent behaviours. Deep learning allows us to\nscale up from principles and circuit models to end-to-end trainable models\ncapable of performing complex tasks. There are many levels at which cognitive\nneuroscientists can use deep learning in their work, from inspiring theories to\nserving as full computational models. Ongoing advances in deep learning bring\nus closer to understanding how cognition and perception may be implemented in\nthe brain -- the grand challenge at the core of cognitive neuroscience.\n\n\nSource: A quantum information-based refoundation of color perception concepts\n  In this paper we deal with the problem of overcoming the intuitive definition\nof several color perception attributes by replacing them with novel\nmathematically rigorous ones. Our framework is a quantum-like color perception\ntheory recently developed, which constitutes a radical change of view with\nrespect to the classical CIE models and their color appearance counterparts. We\nshow how quantum information concepts, as e.g. effects, generalized states,\npost-measurement transformations and relative entropy provide tools that seem\nto be perfectly fit to model color perception attributes as brightness,\nlightness, colorfulness, chroma, saturation and hue. An illustration of the\nefficiency of these novel definitions is provided by the rigorous derivation of\nthe so-called lightness constancy phenomenon.\n\n\nSource: Inverse-Designed Meta-Optics with Spectral-Spatial Engineered Response\n  to Mimic Color Perception\n  Meta-optics have rapidly become a major research field within the optics and\nphotonics community, strongly driven by the seemingly limitless opportunities\nmade possible by controlling optical wavefronts through interaction with arrays\nof sub-wavelength scatterers. As more and more modalities are explored, the\ndesign strategies to achieve desired functionalities become increasingly\ndemanding, necessitating more advanced design techniques. Herein, the\ninverse-design approach is utilized to create a set of single-layer meta-optics\nthat simultaneously focus light and shape the spectra of focused light without\nusing any filters. Thus, both spatial and spectral properties of the\nmeta-optics are optimized, resulting in spectra that mimic the color matching\nfunctions of the CIE 1931 XYZ color space, which links the distributions of\nwavelengths in light and the color perception of a human eye. Experimental\ndemonstrations of these meta-optics show qualitative agreement with the\ntheoretical predictions and help elucidate the focusing mechanism of these\ndevices.\n\n\nSource: Educational Research: Frequency-Based Color Theory wavelength perception neuroscience research study\nComprehensive analysis of Frequency-Based Color Theory wavelength perception neuroscience research study from educational perspective\n\nSource: Educational Research: Frequency-Based Color Theory wavelength perception neuroscience scientific paper\nComprehensive analysis of Frequency-Based Color Theory wavelength perception neuroscience scientific paper from educational perspective",
