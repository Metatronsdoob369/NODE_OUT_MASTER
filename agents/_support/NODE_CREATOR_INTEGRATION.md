## 📞 Sample Creator Voicemail Scripts

### Real Estate Agent Outreach
```
Hi [Agent Name], this is Preston from NODE here in Birmingham, Alabama. 

I hope you're having a great day! I'm reaching out because there have been 
some significant insurance law changes affecting roof claims that directly 
impact your listings in the Birmingham area.

I've been working with several agents at [Brokerage] and around Birmingham 
to help them understand how these changes affect their transactions. 

I'd love to buy you a coffee and share what we're seeing in the market - 
it might help you avoid some potential closing delays.

You can reach me directly at 205-307-9153, or visit us online.

Thanks [Agent Name], and have a great rest of your day!
```

### Storm Damage Alert
```
Attention Birmingham homeowners: This is Preston from NODE. 

We've detected severe weather in the Birmingham area that may have caused roof damage. 

As a licensed and bonded roofing contractor, I'm offering FREE storm damage assessments 
for the next 48 hours. 

Remember, insurance companies require inspections within 30 days of storm damage 
for full coverage. Don't wait until it's too late.

Call NODE at 205-307-9153 for your free assessment.

This is Preston from NODE, protecting Birmingham homes one roof at a time.
